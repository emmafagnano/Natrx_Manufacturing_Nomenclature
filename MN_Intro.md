# Natrx Manufacturing Nomenclature
<br>
This document is intended to establish a systematic way for defining assets in design and manufacturing. This naming system is consistent throughout the mechanical engineering repository for solid models and drawings and should be used when referencing assets within the office or workspace. This System should aim for infinite expandability to unknown future expansion of NATRX as an entity.
