| ### Word/Concept | ### Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| Box  | Container unit into which dry concrete is placed, and then printed using the print hood and injection subassemblies. |
| Laydown Yard | Temporary on-site storage area for completed product. |
| Curing Lot | Reserved area of printed boxes to sit while final ExoForm cures. |
| Breakdown | The process of removing the dry concrete from an ExoForm after a printed shape in a box has cured. |
| Blowdown | Water seeps into other areas than the voxel intended, typically down the hole created by the needle rising through the concrete while the frame rises. |
| Needles | Rigid tubes that submerge into concrete in which water is injected. |
| Pump Array/Wall | Subsystem including the collection pumps used to inject water through the needles. |
| Top-fill | Concept of filling concrete into box around already lowered needles. |
| Finishing | Process of infusing additional water into the ExoForm after printing is complete. Diffusion of water in the concrete mix occurs prior to curing, which leaves a partially hydrated structure in its place. Additional water must be added to allow complete crystallization of the concrete. |
| Breaks | Needles that fail due to cracking, splintering, clogs, or any other reason and must be replaced. |
| Work in Progress (WIP) Exoforms | An ExoForm prior to full hydration, after breakdown. |
| Print Head | Frame that injection needles physically attach to. The print head is raised and lowered to change which layer is being injected. |
| Loading Hood | Apparatus that takes in dry mix from an auger, and distributes it evenly to a box underneath the top-fill subsystem. |
| Submersion "Dunk" Tank | A tank in which partially hydrated ExoForms are lowered into a bath of water to increase the water-to-cement ratio. |
| Compactor | Subassembly responsible for densifying bulk material in-situ. |
