  <tr>
   <td>Box
   </td>
   <td>Container unit into which dry concrete is placed, and then printed using the print hood and injection subassemblies.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Laydown Yard
   </td>
   <td>Temporary on-site storage area for completed product
   </td>

  <tr>
   <td>Curing Lot
   </td>
   <td>Reserved area of printed boxes to sit while final ExoForm cures
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Breakdown
   </td>
   <td>The process of removing the dry concrete from an ExoForm after a printed shape in a box has cured. 
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Blowdown
   </td>
   <td>Water seeps into other areas than the voxel intended, typically down the hole created by the needle rising through the concrete while the frame rises.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Needles
   </td>
   <td>Rigid tubes that submerge into concrete in which water is injected .
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Pump Array/Wall
   </td>
   <td>Subsystem including the collection pumps used to inject water through the needles.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Top-fill
   </td>
   <td>Concept of filling concrete into box around already lowered needles.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Finishing
   </td>
   <td>Process of infusing additional water into the ExoForm after printing is complete. Diffusion of water in the concrete mix occurs prior to curing, which leaves a partially hydrated structure in its place. Additional water must be added to allow complete crystallization of the concrete.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Breaks
   </td>
   <td>Needles that fail due to cracking, splintering, clogs, or any other reason and must be replaced.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Work in Progress (WIP) ExoForms
   </td>
   <td>An ExoForm prior to full hydration, after breakdown. 
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Print Head
   </td>
   <td>Frame that injection needles physically attach to. The print head is raised and lowered to change which layer is being injected.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Loading Hood
   </td>
   <td>Apparatus that takes in dry mix from an auger, and distributes it evenly to a box underneath. The top-fill subsystem.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Submersion “Dunk” tank
   </td>
   <td>A tank in which partially hydrated ExoForms are lowered into a bath of water to increase the water-to-cement ratio.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Compactor
   </td>
   <td>Subassembly responsible for densifying bulk material in-situ.
